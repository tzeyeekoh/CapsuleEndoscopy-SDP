# CapsuleEndoscopy-SDP
 *Abnormality Detection in Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy Images*

Capsule Endoscopy is an invaluable test for the investigation of small bowel pathology, but presents considerable challenges and limitations, such as long and laborious reading times, risk of missing lesions, and lack of locomotion.  
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to accurately detect abnormalities in endoscopy images, thereby serving as an aid for the human reader (Gastroenterology specialist). The framework will utilize deep learning computer vision techniques and transfer learning to leverage on existing pre-trained models.
